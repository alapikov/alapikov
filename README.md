A novice frontend-developer based in Russia. 
Currently working with React/JS, TypeScript, CSS/Sass stack. 
My objectives at the moment are pet project and various JS problems, along with studying theory of frontend and near-the-frontend things.
My professional interests that make me especially passionate are web-design, the art of UI and nice smooth animations :)
The nearest objectives are the learning and mastering of React accompanied by TypeScript and essential JS structures and features.
A bit more distant objectives - Vue, Node, related backend stack technologies.
